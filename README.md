made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

![button](https://github.com/Choi-JaeHyeok-21500749/9461/blob/main/9461_pro.JPG)

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

After understanding the question, I draw some of the sequences.

I notice some rules after that.

1. previous triangle's leg length is added.

2. (i-5) triangle's leg length is added. 

There is some exception in second rule in the beginning, but there is no problem because the leg of triangle is same.


## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
